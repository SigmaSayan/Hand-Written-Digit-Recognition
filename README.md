# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition
ML model using MNIST Dataset
Built an ML learning model for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. Utilized Python, Tensor-
Flow, Keras, and Matplotlib for data preprocessing, model building, and visualization. Implemented a convolutional
neural network (CNN) to achieve high accuracy in digit classification. Enhanced skills in deep learning, neural
network architecture, and model evaluation.
